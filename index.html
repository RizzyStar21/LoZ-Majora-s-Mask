									<h3>Giant's Mask</h3>
									<p>When Link wears the mask, he becomes a giant. It is only usable in Twinmold's chamber at the Stone Tower Temple. Wearing the mask will drain Link's Magic Meter, and if depleted, he will return to normal size. In Majora's Mask 3D, the mask also allows Link to attack with his bare hands, permitting Link to do uppercuts, ground slams, and spin the boss around In Majora's Mask, the Giant's Mask is obtained in the Stone Tower Temple after defeating an Eyegore</p>
